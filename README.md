# Overview
This custom made Network Overlay is a Python script designed to provide real-time ping statistics for Battlefield: Bad Company 2 game servers. It uses the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) overlay that displays ping information for a selected game server. The overlay updates the ping information at regular intervals (faster that default ingame one), allowing you to monitor the stability of your connection to the chosen server.

`For Downloading you can find the linux binary in the Releases`
